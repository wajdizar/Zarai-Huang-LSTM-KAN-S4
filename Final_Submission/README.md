# Code Organization for LSTM, TKAN, and S4D Models

The code for the LSTM and TKAN models is provided in the Python notebook file. In contrast, the code for the S4D model is located in the S4D folder, organized as Python files. The main file for training the S4D model is 'nifty.py', which utilizes the libraries listed in requirements.txt found in the main directory.
