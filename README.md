# TKAN MAMBA Application ([Paper](https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.5146629))


The development of machine learning, particularly deep learning, has significantly advanced time series
analysis in finance, such as predicting future stock prices using Long and
Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks. Building on this, the performance of two
state-of-the-art models for stock price prediction will be examined:

- Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), especially the Temporal Kolmogorov-
Arnold Transformer Networks (TKANs), which utilize an attention mech-
anism to efficiently capture temporal patterns in multivariate data streams.
- Structured State Space Sequence model (S4), with its variant MAMBA, known for excelling in long-range sequence modeling across domains like vision, lan-
guage, and audio.

The study will implement these models to predict future stock prices and evaluate their performance
within an asset allocation problem.
